# EPS109_fall2018  

A selection of notebooks from labs and assigments used to treach "Computer Simulation in Earth and Planetary Science", a Python class in numerical simulation and data analysis taught to upper division students at Berkeley.   

All labs were uploaded after students submitted their homework. Labs may be different next year!
